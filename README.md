Great choice! I too love tuna burgers! Alright, now you can see that you have the option to go ahead and order it up, eat it now, why wait... or maybe you decided you are not quite ready for a tuna burger at this stage of your life, go ahead and remove it from your list by clicking "I do not want this!" Hey, at least you changed your mind before ingesting!

Let's see what you decide to do...

Wow! You never stop surprising me! You decided to eat the tuna burger and wasted NO time at all to eat up a tofu burger! Great, so now you have two burgers that you have eaten at the world famous Eat-Da-Burger restaurant, you are able to click to order it again, or maybe you regret eating that tofu or tuna burger and never want to see it in your list again- go ahead and delete if that is the case. What will you do next?
